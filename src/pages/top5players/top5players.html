  <h2 ion-text color="light">Brian O'Driscoll</h2>
  <ul ion-text color="light">
    <li>Brian O'Driscoll (born 21 January 1979) is a retired Irish professional rugby union player. He played at outside
      centre for the Irish provincial team Leinster and for Ireland. He captained Ireland from 2003 until 2012, and
      captained the British and Irish Lions for their 2005 tour of New Zealand. He is regarded by critics as one of the
      greatest rugby players of all time.</li>
    <li>O'Driscoll is the second most-capped player in rugby union history, having played 141 test matches: 133 for
      Ireland (83 as captain), and 8 for the British and Irish Lions. He scored 46 tries for Ireland and 1 try for the
      Lions in 2001, making him the highest try scorer of all time in Irish Rugby. He is the 8th-highest try scorer in
      international rugby union history, and the highest scoring centre of all time.</li>
    <li>O'Driscoll holds the Six Nations record for most tries scored with 26. He has scored the most Heineken Cup tries
      (30) by an Irishman. O'Driscoll was chosen as Player of the Tournament in the 2006, 2007 and 2009 Six Nations
      Championships. He was inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame on 17 November 2016 at the opening ceremony for

  <h2 ion-text color="light">Jonah Lomu</h2>
  <ul ion-text color="light">
    <li>Jonah Tali Lomu (12 May 1975 â€“ 18 November 2015) was a New Zealand rugby union player. He became the youngest
      ever All Black when he played his first international in 1994 at the age of 19 years and 45 days. Playing on the
      wing Lomu finished his international career with 63 caps and 37 tries. He is regarded as the first true global
      superstar of rugby and consequently had a huge impact on the game. Lomu was inducted into the International Rugby
      Hall of Fame on 9 October 2007, and the IRB Hall of Fame on 24 October 2011.</li>
    <li>Lomu burst onto the international rugby scene during the 1994 Hong Kong Sevens tournament, the same year he made
      his fifteen-a-side debut. He was widely acknowledged as the top player at the 1995 World Cup in South Africa even
      though New Zealand lost the final to the host South Africa. His performance at the Rugby World Cup established him
      as rugby union's biggest drawcard with him swelling attendances at any match where he appeared. He shares the
      Rugby World Cup all-time try scoring record of 15 tries, which he accumulated in only two tournaments.</li>
    <li>He played for several domestic New Zealand provincial or Super Rugby sides, and late in his career played club
      rugby in both Wales and France. These included the Auckland Blues, Chiefs and Hurricanes, and Counties Manukau,
      Wellington, and later North Harbour and the Cardiff Blues.</li>
    <li>Lomu was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome, a serious kidney disorder in 1995, and the disease had a significant
      impact on his playing career and wider life. By 2003 he was on dialysis and in 2004 underwent a kidney transplant.
      He then attempted a comeback but did not play international rugby again, and retired from professional rugby in
      2007. He died unexpectedly on 18 November 2015 after suffering a heart attack associated with his kidney
      condition.</li>

  <h2 ion-text color="light">Richie McCaw</h2>
  <ul ion-text color="light">
    <li>Richard Hugh McCaw ONZ (born 31 December 1980) is a retired New Zealand rugby union player. He captained the
      national team, the All Blacks, in 110 out of his 148 test matches, and won two Rugby World Cups. He is the most
      capped test rugby player of all time, and has won the World Rugby player of the year award a joint record three
      times.</li>
    <li>McCaw was the first All Black to reach 100 caps, and the first rugby union player to win 100 tests. He is the
      most-capped player in rugby union history with 148 caps, having overtaken Brian O'Driscoll's record in 2015. McCaw
      has also equaled the record for most appearances at the Rugby World Cup with Jason Leonard.</li>
    <li>McCaw predominantly played in the openside flanker position for the New Zealand, Crusaders and Canterbury teams,
      but also played as a blindside flanker and no. 8. During McCaw's career, Canterbury won the NPC (later Mitre10
      Cup) five times, and the Crusaders won four Super Rugby titles. As well as two world cups, the All Blacks won
      seven Tri-Nations titles, completed three successful Grand Slam tours and won the Bledisloe Cup eight times.</li>
    <li>He made his debut in 2001 for the Crusaders, and was selected for the All Blacks' 2001 end-of-year tour, despite
      having played only eight minutes of Super 12 rugby. His debut for New Zealand was against Ireland, where he was
      awarded man-of-the-match. McCaw became a regular selection for New Zealand, only missing a few games due to
      recurring concussions. In 2004 he was appointed captain of the All Blacks, whom he led at the 2007 World Cup.
      After their elimination in the quarter-finals, his captaincy came under criticism, but he was retained and
      eventually led the team to consecutive world cup titles in 2011 and 2015, becoming one of only twenty players who
      have won two rugby union world cups.</li>

  <h2 ion-text color="light">Dan Carter</h2>
  <ul ion-text color="light">
    <li>Daniel William Carter (born 5 March 1982) is a New Zealand rugby union player.</li>
    <li>Carter plays for Kobelco Steelers in Japan and played for New Zealand's national team, the All Blacks. He is the
      highest point scorer in Test match rugby, and is considered by many experts as the greatest ever first-five eighth
      (fly-half) in the history of the game. He was named the International Rugby Board Player of the Year in 2005, 2012
      and 2015 (equaling the record three awards of Richie McCaw) and has won three Super Rugby titles with the
      Crusaders, and nine Tri-Nations and Rugby Championships with the All Blacks.</li>
    <li>Carter injured himself during the 2011 Rugby World Cup but was a key member of the 2015 Rugby World Cup-winning
      teams, becoming one of only twenty dual Rugby World Cup winners. In the 2015 Rugby World Cup Final against
      Australia, he successfully kicked four penalties, two conversions and a drop goal. He was named the Man of the
      Match.</li>

  <h2 ion-text color="light">Sir Gareth Edwards</h2>
  <ul ion-text color="light">
    <li>Sir Gareth Owen Edwards, CBE (born 12 July 1947) is a Welsh former rugby union player who played scrum-half and
      has been described by the BBC as arguably the greatest player ever to don a Welsh jersey.</li>
    <li>In 2003, in a poll of international rugby players conducted by Rugby World magazine, Edwards was declared the
      greatest player of all time. In 2007, former England captain Will Carling published his list of the '50 Greatest
      Rugby players' in The Daily Telegraph, and ranked Edwards the greatest player ever, stating; He was a supreme
      athlete with supreme skills, the complete package. He played in the 1970s, but, if he played now, he would still
      be the best. He was outstanding at running, passing, kicking and reading the game. He sits astride the whole of
      rugby as the ultimate athlete on the pitch.</li>
    <li>Edwards was prominent in the Welsh national team that was to the fore in European rugby in the '60s and '70s. He
      is one of a small group of Welsh players to have won three Grand Slams including Ryan Jones, Adam Jones, Gethin
      Jenkins, Gerald Davies and J. P. R. Williams.</li>
    <li>In the 2007 New Year Honours, Edwards became a CBE for services to sport. He was knighted in the Queen's
      Birthday Honours of 2015, for services to sport and for charitable services.</li>
